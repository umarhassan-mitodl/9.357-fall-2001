The links below are online references for additional resources in the field of visual perception. These range from professional societies that maintain links to areas that any reader can explore in this field. Many of the linked sites provide resources for further study, as well as downloadable resources that can be used for classroom teaching.

Cognition
---------

The [Cognitive Science Society](http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/) has the latest news and information on conferences, funding, and employment, along with a host of related conferences.

The [Cognitive Neuroscience Society](http://www.cogneurosociety.org/) is committed to the development of mind and brain research aimed at investigating the psychological, computational, and neuroscientific bases of cognition.

Neuroscience
------------

The [Society for Neuroscience](http://www.sfn.org/) addresses the study of brain development, sensation and perception, learning and memory, movement, sleep, stress, aging and neurological and psychiatric disorders. It also includes the molecules, cells and genes responsible for nervous system functioning.

The [International Brain Research Organization](http://ibro.info/) was founded to enhance the mobilization and utilization of the world's scientific resources for research on the brain.

The [National Institutes of Health](http://www.nih.gov/about/) (NIH) is the steward of medical and behavioral research for the United States, governed under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The [National Science Foundation](http://nsf.gov/) fosters the interchange of scientific information among scientists and engineers in the United States and foreign countries.

Online References
-----------------

[The Human Brain](http://www.vh.org/Providers/Textbooks/BrainAnatomy/BrainAnatomy.html) is an online virtual hospital site hosted by the University of Iowa that provides a stunning array of images of the human central nervous system from infants to adults.

[The Whole Brain Atlas](http://www.med.harvard.edu/AANLIB/home.html), hosted by the Harvard Medical School, displays pictures from MRI to fMRI in various disease states.

Computation
